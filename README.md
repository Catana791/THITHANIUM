A mod for the game Mindustry made by Zarikar2Reshi and uploaded by me due to technical reasons.

I do not take any responsibility for this mod, I am simply the one who uploaded <br>
it because the original creator was unable to do so themselves.

Original README file of the mod: 
  
  Thanks for installing my mod! <br>
  At first, you should know that this was a test mod and it's my first one, so, as all beginners, I took some things to other mods (to understand HOW TO MAKE A MOD. I think the official tutorial is really really useless). <br>
  But I had also other hundreds of ideas, and I couldn't make all ones, due to the lllloooonnnngggg times. <br> <br>

  At second, I'm open to all suggestions, bug reports, bug corrections, feedbaks etc. but NOT of graphics bugs, 'cause I'm still working on the turrets and other graphics bugs. Thanks for all in advance. <br> <br>

  At third, you can always suggest new features by sending the idea to my mail: <br>
 -If it's a really small suggestion, nothing happens. It will just be there. <br>
 -If it's a medium suggestion, you might will be mentioned in the details of the thing/block. <br>
 -If it's a really big suggestion, you will be mentioned in credits (and in GitHub project when I will make it). <br>
 Please note that if you don't want to be mentioned you should specify that in the e-mail. <br>
 Please note also that all above will happen ovviusly only in next updates. <br> <br>

  Last, if you have any reclamation for any thing, send me an e-mail: I will fix it asap and, if it's for the code, you can always ask to be mentioned, if you would. <br> <br>
