name: Universal Fabricator
description: An unit fabric for ALL mod's units (Tier I).
details: Due to convenience of raffined technologies, it costs so lesser and it's so efficient that you should always use it, instead of creating air/ground fabs. It's also very heavily armoured, so why don't use it?
