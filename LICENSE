DON'T use my own mod for yours.
  If you need permission 'cause you liked a sprite o you'd like using code, ask me first either via e-mail:
susb84261@gmail.com or via Discord: Zarikar2Reshi#6207.
  I'm not granting you that I'll answer to the e-mail rapidly, because I can't use Internet whenever I want, but in most cases I won't say no.
However, I want to be asked first.

  WARNING: This mod was made also using materials from others; if you want to use that, ask the other creators, not me. If you don't know whose the material (sprite and/or code) is, ask me and I will say you whose it is.
